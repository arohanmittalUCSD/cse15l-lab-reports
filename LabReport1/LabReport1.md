## Trying Some Commands
Try out some commands!

For Example: 
1. `cd <path>` allows you to navigate the directories of your system
2. `pwd` will allow you to figure out where you currently are
3. `cd ~` should take you directly to the home directory!
4. `ls <directory>` will allow you to find out the contents of a directory without needing to change to it!

Working with commands like these can help one in getting comfortable with the command line and navigating it.

For more examples of commands, try out the commands shown in the image and try to figure out what they do!
